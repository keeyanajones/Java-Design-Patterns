## what's included
- Creational Patterns : 
to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.
- Structural Patterns : 
class and object composition. Inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
- Behavioral Patterns : 
communication between objects.
- J2EE Patterns : 
the presentation tier. These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.
