Java Design Patterns

## what does it do
Two main usages: Common Platform and Best Practices

+ Common Platform - A standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario. For example, a singleton design pattern signifies use of single object so all developers familiar with single design pattern will make use of single object and they can tell each other that program is following a singleton pattern.
+ Best Practices - The best solutions to certain problems faced during software development. Learning these patterns helps unexperienced developers to learn software design in an easy and faster way.

## quick start
Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before

or

Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.
…or create a new repository on the command line

<pre>
echo "# Java-Design-Patterns" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/keeyanajones/Java-Design-Patterns.git
git push -u origin master
</pre>                

…or push an existing repository from the command line

<pre>
git remote add origin https://github.com/keeyanajones/Java-Design-Patterns.git
git push -u origin master
</pre>

…or import code from another repository

You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
ProTip! Use the URL for this page when adding GitHub as a remote.

## what's included
- Creational Patterns : 
to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.
- Structural Patterns : 
class and object composition. Inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
- Behavioral Patterns : 
communication between objects.
- J2EE Patterns : 
the presentation tier. These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.
